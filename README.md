## The Math

Our project explores control theory and feedback from a visual and intuative perspective. Specifically we the guide the viewer through constructing a PID controller, one of the simpilest yet powerful general control systems. The purpose is to alter the behavior of a dynamical system under some constraints on our control over the dynamics. Phrased another way, a controller is a map from an input signal driving our dynmaical system to an output signal which we hope satisfies some property, generally minimising some measure of error. Although highly important to and inspired by engineering, control theory and the larger theory of dynamical systems is highly important in pure and applied mathematics for it forms of the foundation of studies of chaotic and ergodic systems. 

Our implimentation shows the behavior of a second-order differential system under various simple control schemes. The project uses numerical integration to calculate the paths with our error measure being the minimum distance to the target path.
